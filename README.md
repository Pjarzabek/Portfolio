# Portfolio

During 6-months internship as a data analyst at Wayfair in Berlin. Eager to expand skills in the data firelds. 10 years of experience as a freelance copywriter (since 2009). 5 years working remotely in Comparic Group - major website in Poland educating and informing about financial markets (2014-19). MBA in business analytics – 5 years of strong foundations in data science and machine learning (2011-16). Knowledge of Python, Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, NumPy, Spark, Git.

Here are my Python projects:
- [Are new movies longer than they were 10, 20, 50 years ago?](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MoviesRuntimes) – I’m a big fan of movies. Some time ago I wondered if movies nowadays are longer or I just feel this way. To examine this issue, I used IMDb data and did exploratory analysis using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The chart I created received [3.6k upvotes on Reddit’s Data is Beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/a9ne9w/average_movies_runtime_by_year_oc_full_study_in/). The article about my working process and results was [published on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-new-movies-longer-than-they-were-10hh20-50-year-ago-a35356b2ca5b). 
- [Dot Plot in Python](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/DotPlotPython) – Every year I prepare analysis of Oscar nominated movies and publish it on my Facebook wall. In 2019 I wanted to attach something interesting – a dot plot with all movies I’ve seen and rated in my life. Quickly I figured out that there is no plot I need in Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. I decided to modify classic scatterplot to meet my needs. This project shows that I can create new tools if needed. The tutorial about creating dot plots was also [published on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/dotplotpython-c24058dc6689). 
- [Bokeh Trade Balance](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/BokehTradeBalance) – Interactive charts are appealing to the audience, especially people without experience with statistics and data science. This project is a result of my experiments with Bokeh library. I used Trade Balance data from Poland to show how both import and export grew few times since joining EU back in 2004.
- [Medical Appointment No-Show](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MedicalNoShow) – In this project I took the data about medical appointments in Vitoria (Brazil) and tried to predict whether patients will show up for their visit in the hospital. I used a variety of models to get the best results, from logistic regression to random forests and support vector machines.
